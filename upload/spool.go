// Package upload holds in-progress blob uploads. A Session buffers the bytes
// of one upload in memory and spills them to a file in the work directory
// once they exceed a threshold, keeping a running sha256 over everything
// received. A Manager owns the sessions of one registry process and expires
// the ones that go idle. A Spool is the snapshot a finished upload hands to
// the blob store.
