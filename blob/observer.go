// speculative decompose that stages the layer's parts while the engine
// search runs; a prism continues with commit and, when VerifyRoundTrip is
// set, verify; a raw decision or a downgrade ends with raw.

// position, which reaches the size when pass one is done and then holds
// while the engine search reads through ReadAt; in commit it is the staged
// pack's bytes read so far, scaled to the size; in verify the
// bytes recompressed so far; in raw the bytes stored so far. A dedup
// hit reports nothing. Methods are called from the goroutines running
// Put, concurrently for different digests.
